# Hypatos Uploader (Invoices & Lookup Tables)

A modular Streamlit app to:
- Upload **invoices** from CSV, transform them to the Hypatos enrichment schema, and POST to `/v2/enrichment/invoices`.
- Insert **lookup table rows** from CSV/Excel to `/v2/enrichment/lookup-tables/{type}` (e.g., `payment_terms`, `tax_codes`, `central_bank_indicator`, or a **custom** type).

The app is split into pages so you can easily add more data models in the future.

## Features

- **Two pages**:
  - **Upload Invoices**: your original, working transformation logic preserved 1:1, with dry-run and sample CSV generators.
  - **Lookup Tables**: upload Excel/CSV and send **one POST per row**; all values sanitized as **strings** (API requires strings).
- **Leading zeros preserved** from Excel/CSV (e.g., `'00001` â†’ `00001`).
- **Dry run** mode to preview JSON without sending.
- **Payload preview** (first rows) before sending.
- **Throttling** option for lookup inserts.
- **Modular** architecture for easy future pages.
